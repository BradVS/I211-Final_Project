# I211-Final_Project
This is the repository for my final project in I211.
In a group of three, I collaborated to create a website in PHP with CRUD functionality and a MySQL database for renting DVDs. 
This was an untitled project created for a class on information infrastructure. 
The website also implemented SCSS for styling, as well as Javascript for AJAX functions.
The site had a system for renting, tracking rental statusm searching with user-friendly, immediate suggestions based on input, and an administration system that is unable to be 
accessed by customer accounts. For this project, security measures were also implemented, such as input filtering, string sanitation, and basic encryption to prevent unwanted 
effects, or access to sensitive information.

Technologies: HTML, PHP, Javascript, MySQL, CSS, SCSS
